#Data Engineering: 
    A cloud data engineer, also known as a cloud engineer or cloud developer, is someone responsible for the management of corporate apps and data in the cloud and all the technical tasks involved in planning, architecting, migrating, monitoring, and managing a company's cloud systems

#Cloud tools for data engineering:
-Adf
-Azure databicks
-Adls
-Storage account
-Azure Synapse 
-Azure logic app
-Power Bi
-Model building 

#ETL:
   ETL is an abbreviation of Extract, Transform and Load. In this process, an ETL tool extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems then transforms the data like applying calculations, concatenations, etc. and then load the data into the Data Warehouse system

#ELT:
- ELT is a different method of looking at the tool approach to data movement. Instead of transforming the data before it’s written, ELT lets the target system to do the transformation. The data first copied to the target and then transformed in place.
-ELT usually used with no-Sql databases like Hadoop cluster, data appliance or cloud installation.

#OLTP:
-OLTP or Online Transaction Processing is a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrently—online banking, shopping, order entry, or sending text messages, for example. These transactions traditionally are referred to as economic or financial transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for accounting or reporting purposes

#OLAP:
-OLAP on big data is a powerful concept that involves the pre-aggregation of massive amounts of data and builds multidimensional cubes to get super-fast query results

#SQL Server:
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases
SQL stands for Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
SQL can execute queries against a database
SQL can retrieve data from a database
SQL can insert records in a database
SQL can update records in a database
SQL can delete records from a database
SQL can create new databases
SQL can create new tables in a database
SQL can create stored procedures in a database
SQL can create views in a database
SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

# azure Cosmosdb:
 Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed, multi-model database. Azure Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and
independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure’s geographic regions. It offers throughput, latency, 
availability, and consistency guarantees with comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs). Azure Cosmos DB provides APIs for
the following data models, with SDKs available in multiple languages
-SQL API
-MongoDB API
-Cassandra API
-Graph (Gremlin) API
-Table API

# Apache Cassandra:
 Apache Cassandra is an open-source no SQL database that is used for handling big data. Apache Cassandra has the
capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Apache Cassandra was originally developed at Facebook after
that it was open-sourced in 2008 and after that, it become one of the top-level Apache projects in 2010.

It is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent.
It is column-oriented database.
Its distributed design is based on Amazon’s Dynamo and its data model on Google’s Big table.
It is Created at Facebook and it differs sharply from relational database management systems

Features of Cassandra:
-Easy data distribution
-Flexible data storage
-Elastic scalability
-Fast writes
-Always on Architecture
-Fast linear-scale performance
-Transaction support
